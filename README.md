## 🔥 Latest Updates : 

### 14th of April 2026: WanGP v11.31, LTX-2 Mega Mix
Lots of nice goodies for **LTX-2**:

- **LTX-2.3 Distilled 1.1**: new version of the *Distilled model* released by *LTX team*, it should offer better audio and visuals. You will find also a Dev 1.1 version which uses Distilled 1.1 for Phase 2.

- **VBVR Lora Preset**: This LoRA enhances the base LTX-2 for Enhanced Complex Prompt Understanding, Improved Motion Dynamics & Temporal Consistency. You can select it in the *Settings list* at the top.

- **Phase 1/2 Choice**: you can now either you go for a good old *2 Phases Gen* (1st Phase Low Res, 2nd shorter Phase High res) or go straight to a single High Res Phase (needs more VRAM and slower, but potentially higher quality). Please note that Outpainting mode and Pose/Edge/Depth extractors are always using 1 phase.

- **Improved Sliding Window**: transition between windows should be less noticable, *Sliding Windows overlapped Frames* carry now also the audio of the overlapped frames, so the higher the number of overlapped frames the higher the chance that the sound / voice used in the previous window will be used in the new one.

- **Video Length not Limited by Audio**: if you provide an Audio input, WanGP will no longer stops when the audio is consumed. It will continue the Video/Audio Gen based on the content of your Text prompt, and guess what ? it may reuse the same voice/sound used up to now !  This is an option, you need to check the checkbox *Video Length not Limited by Audio*.

- **Silent Movie Mode**: if for some reason you want video with not only no sound but that takes into account that there is no sound (you dont want people to open their mouth for instance), just now leave the *Control Audio* empty

- **Process Full Video Plugin**: this *bundled PlugIn* which needs to be enabled first in *the PlugIn tab*, right now supports only *Outpainting*. It relies on *LTX2 Lora outpainting*. It is more or less a *Super Sliding Windows* mode but without the *RAM restrictions* and no risk to explode the *Video Gallery* with huge files. If you are patient enough you can change the Aspect Ratio of a few hours movie (check out below the 1 min sample). Behold how *Sliding Windows transitions* are almost invisible !

- **WanGP API Video Gen**: *Plugin Developers* can now *Queue a Gen* directly from a plugin. This opens the possibility of plugins that place various gen orders and then combine the results (hint: we could have our very own version of *LTX-Destop* inside WanGP).

*update 11.31*: fixed phase 1 forced incorrectly in some cases

### 11th of April 2026: WanGP v11.26, Now I Can See

- **LTX-2 Ic Lora Rebooted**: *Ic Loras* behave like *Control Nets* and can do *Video to Video* by applying an effect specific to the Ic Lora for instance *Pose Extraction*, *Upsampling*, *Transfer Camera Movement*, ...  More and More Ic Loras are available nowadays. Until now WanGP Ic Lora implementation was based on the official LTX-2 github implementation (which a 2 phases process where the Ic Lora is only applied during the first low res phase). However I have just discovered that all the Ic Loras around expect in fact the ComfyUI implementation which is one phase only process at full res. 

So from then on WanGP Ic Lora will work this way too. The downside is that a single Full Res pass is much more GPU intensive. But all is good in WanGP world, as the LTX2 VRAM optimisations will allow you to use Ic Loras at resolutions impossible anywhere else.

As a bonus I have tuned *Sliding Windows* for Ic Loras, and if you set *Overlap Size* to a single frame, transitions between windows when using Ic Lora will be almost invisible. 

- **Outpaint Ic Lora**: this new impressive Ic Lora will be loaded automatically if you select the *Control Video for Ic Lora* option and enable *Outpainting*. If you use Sliding Windows with Outpainting you will be able to outpaint a full movie (assuming you have enough RAM).

- **New Outpainting Auto Change Aspect Ratio**: As a reminder WanGP let you define manually where an Outpainting should happen. Alternatively you can now ask WanGP to use outpainting to change the *Width/ Height Aspect ratio* of the Control Video. For instance you can turn any 16/9 video into a 4/3 video by generating new details instead of adding black bars. The *Top/Bottom/Left/Right Sliders* in this new mode will be used to define which area should be expanded in priority to meet the requested aspect ratio.. 

-- **New One Click Install / Update Scripts**: We have to thank **Tophness / @steve_Jabz** for that one. *Huge Kudos to him!* The scripts will not only install WanGP but also all the *Kernels* (among *Triton, Sage, Flash, GGuf, Lightx2v, Nunchaku*) supported by your GPU. Please have a look at the instructions further down. Dont't hesitate to share feedback or report any issue.

*update 11.26*: fixed outpainting ignored with if Manual Expansion was selected

### 8th of April 2026: WanGP v11.22, Self Destructing Model

- **Magi Human**: this is a newly *Talking Head* model that accepts either a *custom soundrack* or can generate the *audio speech* that comes with the video. 
   - *The bad news* :it is VRAM hungry (targets RTX 5090+) and very res picky, that is the ouput res must be either 256p or 1080p (using a 2 stage pipeline with upsampling). There is also a 540p version (using also an upsampler) but it is not included as I found it unpractical (ghosting guaranteed if your output is not exactly the right height/width ratio), 
   - *The good news* : now that it is WanGP optimized, 101 frames at 1080p requires "only" 16 GB of VRAM. If you dont have that much VRAM I recommend to still go for 1080p but set a 45 frames *Sliding Window* (not too low to avoid artifacts) as *Sliding Windows* sometime works well with this model.  

**I have spent a lot of time optimizing Magi Human, but I am not yet sure it is worth keeping it given all the constraints to run this model. So this is where I need YOU. Please share your experience using Magi Human on the Discord server and you shall decide its fate. Should we keep it or send it to the model graveyard ?**

- **Ace 1.5 Turbo XL**: the best open source song generator has now a big brother *XL* that delivers better audio quality and sticks closer to the requested lyrics. 

- **LTX 2 Id Lora**: due to a huge popular demand I have added this one (it is a new *Generate Video* option). You can provide a voice audio sample, a start image and text script and it will turn LTX 2/2.3 into talking heads. Cost is high to get this feature as **Id Lora works only with LTX2/2.3 DEV**. By chance it seems it can produce decent results in only 10 inference steps. To get the best results it is recommended to use prefix tags [VISUAL], [SPEECH] & [SOUND]. Alternatively you can use WanGP *Prompt Enhancer* that has been to tuned to generate a prompt following this syntax. 

- **LTX 2 NAG**: you can now inject a *Negative Prompt* even if you use the Distilled Model thanks to *NAG* support for LTX 2

- **LTX 2 DEV HQ Mode**: this High Quality mode should produce better output at higher res. You can turn it on using the new *HQ (res2s)* Sampler and set 15 steps and guidance rescaler to 0.45. It is compatible with *Id Loras*. Note that a HQ steps is twice as slow as a vanilla Dev step, so it is going to be as slow as Dev if not slower.

- **LTX2 DEV Presets**: Vanilla Dev mode & HQ Mode have lots of tunable settings. To make your life easier I have added selectionable presets in the *Settings Drop Downbox*

- **More Deepy** : 
   - *UI Improvements*: you can *queue* requests by inserting empty lines between two requests, get the last turn by clicking the *Down Arrow*
   - *More Responsive*: Deepy should execute much more quickly consecutive actions
   - *More Reliable*: fast full context compaction (when deepy ran out of tokens), Deepy will remember what you stopped / aborted
   - *More Capabilities*: you can ask Deepy to specifiy a *guidance*, *denoising strength*, ... value (the value defined in the *tool template* will be overridden)

As a reminder beside writting huge essays about how great you are, Deepy can generate Video, Image & Audio, extract / transcribe / trim / resize (when applicable) video or audio clip, inspect the content of an image or a video frame, generate black frames, ... Deepy used Tool templates but you can specify for one task the loras, number of frames, dimensions, ... There is also a CLI version of Deepy quite useful for remote use. Please check the fulldoc *docs/DEEPY.md*. 

- **Multi Multilines Prompts**: check new options in *"How to Process each Line of the Text Prompt"*, you can now have multiple multi lines prompts. They just need to be separated by an empty line.
   
 *update 11.21*: added Ace Step 1.5 Turbo XL\
 *update 11.22*: added LTX2 NAG

### March 30th 2026: WanGP v11.13, The Machine Within The Machine

Meet **Deepy** your friendly *WanGP Agent*.

It works *offline* with as little of *8 GB of VRAM* and won't *divulge your secrets*. It is *100% free* (no need for a ChatGPT/Claude subscription).

You can ask Deepy to perform for you tedious tasks such as: 
```text
generate a black frame, crop a  video, extract a specific frame from a video, trim an audio, ...
```

Deepy can also perform full workflows:
```text
1) Generate an image of a robot disco dancing on top of a horse in a nightclub.
2) Now edit the image so the setting stays the same, but the robot has gotten off the horse and the horse is standing next to the robot.
3) Verify that the edited image matches the description; if it does not, generate another one.
4) Generate a transition between the two images.
```
or

```text
Create a high quality image portrait that you think represents you best in your favorite setting. Then create an audio sample in which you will introduce the users to your capabilities. When done generate a video based on these two files.
```

Deepy can also transcribe the audio content of a video (*new to WanGP 11.11*)
```text
extract the video from the moment it says "Deepy changed my life"
```

*Deepy* reuses the *Qwen3VL Abliterated* checkpoints and it is highly recommended to install the *GGUF kernels* (check docs/INSTALLATION.md) for low VRAM / fast inference. **now available with Linux!**

Please install also *flash attention 2* and *triton* to enable *vllm* and get x2/x3 speed gain and lower VRAM usage.

You can customize Deepy to use the settings of your choice when generating a video, image, ... (please check docs/DEEPY.Md). 

*Go the Config > Prompt Enhancer / Deep tab to enable Deepy (you must first choose a Qwen3.5VL Prompt Enhancer)*

**Important**: in order to save Deepy from learning all the specificities of each model to generate image, videos or audio, Deepy uses *Predefined Settings Templates* for its six main tools (*Generate Video*, *Generate Image*, ...). You can change the templates used in a session or even add your own settings. Just have a look at the doc.

With WanGP 11.11 you can *ask Deepy to generate a Video or an Image in specific dimensions and also a number of frames for a video*. You can also specify an optional *number of inference of steps* or *loras* to use with *multipliers*. If you don't mention any of these to Deepy, Deepy Default settings or the current Templated Settings will be used instead.

WanGP 11 addresses a long standing Gradio issue: *Queues keep being processed even if your Web Browser is in the background*. Beware this feature may drain more battery, so you can disable it in the *Config / General tab*.

You have maybe also noticed the new option *Keep Intermediate Sliding Windows* in the *Config / Outputs* tab that allows you to discard intermediate *Sliding Windows*


### March 17th 2026: WanGP v10.9875, Prompt Enhancer has just Been Abliterated

- **Qwen3.5 VL Abliterated Prompt Enhancer**: new choice of Prompt Enhancer
   * Based on widely acclaimed *Qwen3.5 model* that has just been released
   * *Uncensored* thanks to the *Abliterating* process that nullifies any *LLM will* to decline any of your request
   * 4 choices of models: depending on how much VRAM you have *4B & 9B models*, and *GGUF Q4* or *Int8*
   * *vllm accelerated* x5 faster, if Flash Attention 2 & Triton are installed (please check docs/INSTALLATION.md) 
   * *Think Mode*: for complex prompt queries
   
   Also you can now expand or override a *System Prompt prompt Enhancer* with add @ or @@ (check new doc *PROMPTS.md*)

- **GGUF CUDA Kernels**: 15% speed gain when using GGUF on Diffusion Video Models & x3 speed with GGUF LLM (*Qwen 3.5 VL GGUF* for instance). GGUF Kernels are for the moment only available for Windows (please check docs/INSTALLATION.md).

- **LTX2.3 Improvements**
   * *End Frame without Start Frame*: you know how your story ends but want to see how it started, just give an End Frame (no start Frame) 
   * New GGUF Checkpoints
   * VAE Decoding hopefully should expose less banding
   * *Multiple Frames Injections*: inject at different positions the reference frames of your choice (works for LTX-2.0 too)
   * *Image Strength* can be applied now too *End Frames* & *Injected Frames*
   * New Spatial Upsampler 1.1, hotfix supposed to improved quality with long video
   * *More VRAM optimisations*: Oops I dit it again ! not that is was needed since WanGP is by far the LTX2 implementation that needs the least VRAM. But now we can in theory (output wont look nice due to LTX2 limitations) generate 15s at full 4K with 24GB of VRAM. So it means that with lower config you should be able to generate longer videos at 720p/1080p. As a bonus you get a 8% speedup.
   * *NVFP4 Dev checkpoint*: if you have a RTX 50xx, help yourself 

- **WanGP API**: rejoice developers (or agents) among you ! WanGP offers now an internal API that allows you to use WanGP as a backend for your apps. It is subject to compliance to the terms & conditions of WanGP license and more specifically to inform the users of your app that WanGP is working behind the scene.

- **LTX Desktop WanGP**: as a sample app (made just for fun) that uses WanGP API, you may try LTX Desktop. This app offers Video / Audio nice editing capabilities but will require 32+ VRAM to run. As now it uses WanGP as its core engine, VRAM requirements are much smaller. It will use LTX 2.3 for Video Gen & Z Image turbo fo Image gen. You can reuse (in theory) your current WanGP install with *LTX Destop WanGP*. https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/LTX-Desktop-WanGP

- **New Audio Ouput formats in mp4**: audio stored in video file can now be of higher quality (*AAC192 - AAC320*) or *ALAC* (lossless). Please note that you wont be able listen to ALAC audio track directly in the webapp.

Also note as people preferred mataynone v1 over v2 I have added an option to select matanyone version in the Config / Extension tab

*update 10.9871*: Improved Qwen3.5 GGUF Prompt Enhancer Output Quality & added Think mode\
*update 10.9872*: Added LTX 2.0/2.3 frames injection\
*update 10.9873*: Fixed low fidelity LTX2 injected frames + added Image Strength slider for end & injected frames\
*update 10.9874*: Replaced LTX-2.3 spatial upsampler by hotfix v1.1\
*update 10.9875*: LTX-2 more VRAM optimisations + NVFP4 checkpoint

### March 7th 2026: WanGP v10.981, Expecting an Update ? 

- **LTX-2 2.3**: 0 day delivery of LTX 2 latest version with better *audio*, *image 2 video* and *greater details*. This model is bigger (22B versus 19B), but with WanGP VRAM usage will be still ridiculously low. Try it at 720p or 1080p, this is where it will shine the most !

*Control Video Support* (*Ic lora Union Control*) will let you transfer *Human Motion*, *Edges*, ... in your new video.

For expert users, *Dev* finetune offers extra new configurable settings (*modality guidance*, *audio guidance*, *STG pertubation/skip self attention *, *guidance rescaling*). LTX team suggests: Cfg=3, Audio cfg=7, Modality Cfg=3, Rescale=0.7, STG Perturbation Skip Attention on all steps.

I recommend to stick to the *Distilled* finetune for higher resolutions (see sample video below) as it seems to have been distilled from a higher quality model (pro model?).

- **Kiwi Edit**: a great model that lets you edit video and / or inject objects in a video. It exists in 3 flavours depending on what you want to do

- **SVI PRO2 End Frames**: this should allow in theory to generate very long shots by splitting one shot into sub shots (sliding windows) by inserting key frames (the *End Frames*). This is an alternative to the *Infinitalk* references frames method (see my old release notes). I am waiting for your feedback to know which method is the best one.

- **Upgraded Models Selector** with *already Downloaded indicator*: Next to each model or finetune, you will find a colored square: *Blue* = fully downloaded & available, *Yellow* = partially downloaded & *Black* = not downloaded at all. Please note that the square color will depend on your current choices of requested model quantization.

- **Upgraded Models Manager**: colors squares have also been added so that you can see in glance what has already been downloaded. New filter for a quick model lookout. List of missing files per finetune.

- **Matanyone 2**: everyone favorite Mask extractor has been been updated and is now more precise

*update 10.981*: LTX2.3 Ic Lora Support & expert settings, Matanyone 2, SVI Pro end frames

The 1-click automated scripts for both **Windows (`.bat`)** and **Linux/macOS (`.sh`)** make installation, environment management, and updates as seamless as possible. These scripts will not only install WanGP but also best acceleration kernels (Triton, Sage, Flash, GGuf, Lightx2v, Nunchaku) available for your config.

*👉 **Windows Users:** Double-click the `.bat` files. **Linux Users:** Run the `.sh` files in your terminal.*

#### **1️⃣ Installation (`scripts\install.bat` | `scripts/install.sh`)**

**Choose Installation Type**
- **Auto Install**
- **Manual Install**

**Manual Install**

If you selected Manual Install, you will be guided through:

1. **Choose your package manager**
2. **Name your environment**
3. **Select your Install Mode**

#### 2️⃣ Starting the App (`scripts\run.bat` | `scripts/run.sh`)
Once installed, use this script to launch the application. It runs WAN2GP using your active environment.

##### ⚙️ Customizing Launch Arguments (`args.txt`)
If you want to pass extra command-line flags to the WAN2GP launcher (like enabling advanced UI features or automatically opening your browser), create an `args.txt` file in your `scripts` folder.

**Example `args.txt`:**
```text
--advanced  --open-browser
```

#### 3️⃣ Updating & Upgrading (`scripts\update.bat` | `scripts/update.sh`)
Use this script to get the latest updates for WAN2GP and upgrade dependencies.
* **1. Update:** Fetches the latest code from GitHub (`git pull`) and updates requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* **2. Upgrade:** Allows you to manually individually upgrade heavy backend components (like PyTorch, Triton, Sage Attention) based on your hardware profile.

#### 4️⃣ Managing Environments (`scripts\manage.bat` | `/manage.sh`)
Use this script to manage and switch between your sandboxed environments safely.

* **Example Scenario:** Let's say you have an environment named `env_stable` that works perfectly, but you want to try the new "Use Latest" combo. Instead of risking your working setup, you can run `install.bat`, create a *new* environment called `env_testing`, and select "Use Latest".
* If the testing environment breaks or gives you errors, you can simply open `manage.bat`, select **Set Active Environment**, and switch back to `env_stable`. You are back up and running instantly.

### One-click (Pinokio) installer:

Get started instantly with [Pinokio App](https://pinokio.computer/)\
It is recommended to use in Pinokio the Community Scripts *wan2gp* or *wan2gp-amd* by **Morpheus** rather than the official Pinokio install.

---

### Manual installation: (old python 3.10, to be deprecated)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu128
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual installation: (new python 3.11 setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.11.14
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the application:
```bash
python wgp.py
```

First time using WanGP ? Just check the *Guides* tab, and you will find a selection of recommended models to use.

#### Update the application (stay in the old python / pytorch version):
If using Pinokio use Pinokio to update otherwise:
Get in the directory where WanGP is installed and:
```bash
git pull
conda activate wan2gp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Upgrade to 3.11, Pytorch 2.10, Cuda 13/13.1 (for non GTX10xx users)
I recommend creating a new conda env for the Python 3.11 to avoid bad surprises. Let's call the new conda env *wangp* (instead of *wan2gp* the old name of this project)
Get in the directory where WanGP is installed and:
```bash
git pull
conda create -n wangp python=3.11.9
conda activate wangp
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Git Errors
Once you are done you will have to reinstall *Sage Attention*, *Triton*, *Flash Attention*. Check the **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)** -

if you get some error messages related to git, you may try the following (beware this will overwrite local changes made to the source code of WanGP):
```bash
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
conda activate wangp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When you have the confirmation it works well you can then delete the old conda env:
```bash
conda uninstall -n wan2gp --all  
```

#### Run headless (batch processing):

Process saved queues without launching the web UI:
```bash
# Process a saved queue
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip
```
Create your queue in the web UI, save it with "Save Queue", then process it headless. See [CLI Documentation](docs/CLI.md) for details.
